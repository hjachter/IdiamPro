It's an AI-native outlining platform that doesn't just store your knowledge — it actively helps you think.

      "content": "<h3>Why IdiamPro vs. Other Tools?</h3><h4>Compared to Traditional Outliners</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Unlimited depth:</strong> Most outliners limit how many levels deep you can go. IdiamPro has no limits — nest as deep as you need.</p></li><li><p><strong>Built-in AI:</strong> Traditional outliners have no AI. IdiamPro generates content that understands your entire document.</p></li><li><p><strong>Import anything:</strong> Other outliners require manual copy-paste. IdiamPro pulls in PDFs, YouTube videos, audio, and web pages automatically.</p></li><li><p><strong>Handles massive documents:</strong> Other tools slow down at a few thousand items. IdiamPro handles 66,000+ without breaking a sweat.</p></li><li><p><strong>Built-in research assistant:</strong> IdiamPro doesn't just store your sources — it works like a research assistant. Pull in PDFs, YouTube videos, audio recordings, web pages, and existing outlines, and AI synthesizes them into a single integrated outline that weaves together the knowledge from all your sources. Think of how a PhD student synthesizes dozens of papers into a thesis, or how a researcher integrates findings across studies — IdiamPro does that for you automatically.</p></li><li><p><strong>Universal knowledge unification:</strong> Your knowledge is scattered everywhere — AI conversations spread across ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini; research trapped in PDFs; insights buried in YouTube videos, audio recordings, web pages, and Google Docs. IdiamPro is the first tool that unifies all of these sources into a single, structured knowledge base. Capture highlights from any LLM, import documents in any format, and AI synthesizes everything together in context. One place for all your knowledge, no matter where it originated.</p></li></ul><h4>Compared to AI Writing Tools</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Structure-aware:</strong> AI writing tools treat your document as one flat block of text. IdiamPro's AI understands your outline hierarchy and writes content that fits.</p></li><li><p><strong>No length limits:</strong> AI writing tools hit token limits on long documents. IdiamPro works with documents of any size.</p></li><li><p><strong>Private AI option:</strong> AI writing tools send everything to the cloud. IdiamPro can run AI entirely on your own computer — your data never leaves your machine.</p></li></ul><p></p>",

      "content": "<h3>IdiamPro as a Second Brain</h3><p>The \"second brain\" concept (popularized by Tiago Forte's <em>Building a Second Brain</em> methodology) is about capturing, organizing, distilling, and expressing knowledge. IdiamPro does all four — but goes far beyond what typical tools in this space offer.</p><h4>What typical second brain tools do (Notion, Obsidian, Roam)</h4><ul><li>Capture and store notes</li><li>Link ideas together</li><li>Search and retrieve</li></ul><h4>What IdiamPro adds</h4><ul><li><strong>AI that synthesizes your knowledge</strong> — not just stores it. IdiamPro actively helps you think by connecting and integrating ideas across your entire document.</li><li><strong>Multi-source import:</strong> Pull in PDFs, YouTube videos, audio recordings, web pages, and existing outlines automatically — no manual copy-paste.</li><li><strong>Hierarchical structure:</strong> Mirrors how people naturally think about complex topics, with unlimited nesting depth.</li><li><strong>Context-aware content generation:</strong> AI writes content that understands the full context of your knowledge base, not just the current page.</li><li><strong>Massive scale:</strong> Handle 66,000+ items without slowing down — far beyond what other tools can manage.</li></ul><h4>A Living Outline — The Knowledge Molecule</h4><p>Think of your IdiamPro outline like a DNA molecule. DNA contains your entire genetic code, but at any moment only specific genes are unfolded and expressed — the rest stays compactly coiled, ready when needed. Your IdiamPro outline works the same way. Your full second brain holds everything — all your knowledge, all your sources, all your ideas — but you expand only the areas you're actively working with and collapse everything else. When your focus shifts, you fold one area closed and unfold another.</p><p>This is why we call an IdiamPro outline a <strong>Knowledge Molecule</strong>. It's not a static document — it's a living, structured entity that contains your entire knowledge base while expressing only what you need right now. Like DNA, it grows, adapts, and organizes complexity into something you can work with.</p><p>This isn't just an organizational trick. It's what makes it possible to work with a knowledge base of thousands of items without feeling overwhelmed. You're never looking at everything at once — you're looking at exactly what's relevant right now, with the full context of everything else one click away.</p><p><strong>An IdiamPro outline is a living thing.</strong> It grows as you learn. It adapts as your focus changes. It holds the full complexity of your knowledge while showing you only what you need in the moment — just like DNA expresses only the genes the cell needs right now, while keeping the entire genome intact and ready.</p><h4>Capture Ideas When They Come</h4><p>Working on one thing and an idea hits you for something else? Drop it into your outline right where it belongs. IdiamPro holds the context so you don't have to — your second brain remembers it, and you can pick it up later without losing your train of thought. That's what a second brain is for: letting you think freely without worrying about losing ideas.</p><h4>The Key Difference</h4><p>Most second brain tools are <strong>passive</strong> — they hold what you put in. IdiamPro is <strong>active</strong>. It synthesizes your sources, generates content that builds on your existing structure, and lets you work at a scale that would be unmanageable manually. It's not just a place to store knowledge — it's a research assistant that synthesizes hundreds or even thousands of sources into a knowledge base you can use to draw original conclusions.</p><p>That's what makes a Knowledge Molecule different from an ordinary outline. It's alive — it grows, folds, unfolds, and evolves with your thinking.</p>",

The IdiamPro website is generated directly from this marketing outline. We maintain our knowledge base in IdiamPro, and it becomes our website. This isn't just a feature — it's a model that shows every user how to do the same thing for their own business, project, or organization.</p><p><strong>Website generation from an outline is a product feature that others will want.</strong> Imagine maintaining your company's website as an outline — update the outline, the website updates. No separate CMS, no context switching, no content drift.</p><h4>Additional Output Formats (Roadmap)</h4><ul><li><strong>Textbook:</strong> Generate a full textbook with chapters, sections, and pedagogy from your knowledge outline</li><li><strong>Screenplay:</strong> Transform story outlines into properly formatted screenplays</li><li><strong>Article / Blog Post:</strong> Turn any section into a polished, publication-ready article</li><li><strong>Newsletter:</strong> Select a subtree and generate a newsletter from it</li><li><strong>Presentation:</strong> Generate slide decks from outline sections</li><li><strong>Report:</strong> Create executive reports, research reports, and white papers</li><li><strong>Course Materials:</strong> Generate lesson plans, student guides, and assessments</li><li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Generate technical docs, API references, and user guides</li><li><strong>Email Campaign:</strong> Turn product or marketing outlines into email sequences</li><li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Generate platform-specific posts from key points in your outline</li></ul><h4>The Key Advantage</h4><p>Because IdiamPro has the full context of your structured knowledge, every output format benefits from that context. The AI doesn't just reformat text — it understands the hierarchy, the relationships between ideas, and the full scope of your knowledge base. This produces dramatically better output than tools that work from flat documents.</p><h4>The Complete Picture</h4><p><strong>Universal input</strong> (PDFs, YouTube, audio, web, AI chats, Google Docs) → <strong>Structured knowledge</strong> (your second brain) → <strong>Universal output</strong> (any format your project needs). IdiamPro is the hub that connects all your sources to all your outputs.</p>",

The result is breakthrough insights buried across multiple platforms in flat, chronological chat logs with no structure and no connection to each other or your other work.</p><p><strong>Process:</strong></p><ol><li>After an AI conversation produces valuable insights, open the relevant outline in IdiamPro</li><li>Create a node where the insight belongs in your knowledge structure</li><li>Paste the key highlights or the full conversation</li><li>Use AI to summarize and integrate the new knowledge with your existing outline</li><li>Conversations that went in the wrong direction? Simply delete the node — no clutter</li></ol><p><strong>Example:</strong> A product manager has 50 conversations with Claude about pricing strategy over 3 months. Instead of scrolling through chat history, the key insights live in their Pricing Strategy outline — organized by theme, synthesized with market research, and ready to reference anytime.</p><p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> IdiamPro is the first tool that unifies AI conversations from every LLM you use into a single structured knowledge base. No more switching between ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini trying to find that one conversation. Your insights live where they belong — in context, organized, and ready to build on.</p>",

The outline serves as a CMS — edit the outline in IdiamPro, and the website updates automatically. Some sections are public-facing (shown on the website), others are private (internal planning only).</p><h3>Design Requirements</h3><ul><li><strong>Responsive design</strong> — mobile-first, works across all screen sizes (phone, tablet, desktop)</li><li>Use existing Tailwind breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)</li><li>Touch-friendly navigation on mobile</li><li>Consistent with IdiamPro's Tailwind/shadcn design system</li></ul><h3>Implementation Tasks</h3><ul><li><input type=\"checkbox\"> Register domain (if not done)</li><li><input type=\"checkbox\"> Add public/private visibility to nodes (tag, property, or naming convention) so the website knows which sections to display</li><li><input type=\"checkbox\"> Build Next.js website that reads this outline and renders public nodes as web pages</li><li><input type=\"checkbox\"> Use existing Tailwind/shadcn design system for visual consistency with the app</li><li><input type=\"checkbox\"> Map outline sections to website pages: Hero, Features, Workflows, Platforms, Pricing, Downloads</li><li><input type=\"checkbox\"> Set up email capture for launch list</li><li><input type=\"checkbox\"> Create documentation/help section</li><li><input type=\"checkbox\"> Set up automated publish flow: save outline → website updates</li></ul><h3>Audience-Based Visibility</h3><p>Each node gets an <code>audience</code> property (array) that controls who can see it. When rendering for a given viewer, hidden nodes are completely invisible — no table of contents entry, no hyperlinks, no trace.</p><h4>Audience Tags</h4><ul><li><strong>public</strong> — anyone visiting the website</li><li><strong>customer</strong> — registered or paying users</li><li><strong>developer</strong> — technical audience (API docs, integration guides, system requirements)</li><li><strong>tester</strong> — beta testers (unreleased features, known issues)</li><li><strong>internal</strong> — team only (action items, work planning, production notes)</li></ul><h4>Rendering Rules</h4><ul><li>Filter nodes by viewer's audience tag</li><li>Prune table of contents — hidden nodes don't appear</li><li>Strip links — hyperlinks to hidden nodes are removed or replaced with plain text</li><li>Cascade — if a parent is hidden, all children are hidden regardless of their own tags</li></ul><h4>Section Assignments</h4><ul><li><strong>public:</strong> Product Overview, Features &amp; Capabilities, Workflows &amp; Use Cases, Platform Support, Subscription Tiers</li><li><strong>customer:</strong> Optional Enhancements (setup guides), System Requirements</li><li><strong>developer:</strong> System Requirements, Optional Enhancements (technical detail)</li><li><strong>tester:</strong> Platform Roadmap (upcoming features)</li><li><strong>internal:</strong> Video Content Support, Marketing Action Items, Android work planning</li></ul>",
